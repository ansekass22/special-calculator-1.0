# special-calculator-1.0
This program is not a common pocket calculator but rather some kind of "special" calculator that does calculations for positive integer numbers only. Instead of basic operations (addition, substraction, multiplication, division) there are operations that can be done for positive integers. These operations are:
- Factorial (n! = 1 * 2 *...* (n-1) * n)
- Triangular number (T(n) = 1 + 2 + ... + (n-1) + n, triangular numbers can actually be found by formula n(n+1)/2 but in this calculator they're made iteratively from former triangular numbers)
- Tetrahedral numbers (Te(n) = T(1)+...+T(n), also calculated iteratively instead of existing formula Te(n)=n(n+1)(n+2)/6)
- Fibonacci numbers
- Coefficients of Pascal's triangle
- Factorials of a number (not iterative)
 
Version 1.0 contains only the main program and modules for operations but in later versions I am going to have a system that saves calculations into the files for later use.
